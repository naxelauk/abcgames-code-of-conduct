# Code of Conduct

ABC Games is a community event held approximately monthly in London. The main activity at our events are board games supplied and played by attendees. The attendees self identify as from the London FL community. Merely being a board games player in London does not make you part of our community.

We value the participation of each member of the ABC Games community and want all attendees to have an enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout our events, whether officially run by the ABC active organisers or not.

To make clear what is expected, all staff, attendees, organisers, and volunteers at any ABC Games event are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event.

## Our Standards

ABC Games is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or socio-economic status.

Examples of behaviour that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Being kind to others
- Behaving professionally
- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behaviour by participants include:

- Harassment of event participants in any form
- Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
- Violent threats or language directed against another person
- ~~Sexual language and imagery in any conference venue, including talks~~
- Insults or put downs
- Sexist, racist, homophobic, transphobic, ableist, or exclusionary jokes
- Excessive swearing
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Unwelcome physical contact
- Sustained disruption games, such as caused by excessive noise
~~- Other conduct that is inappropriate for a professional audience including people of many different backgrounds~~

(The two items above are struck out because they did not seem appropriate for our community. We **do** allow sexual language and imagery so long as it is appropriate and consensual. It should be noted that in the middle of a game people cannot easily walk away so attendees should err on the side of caution)

Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in behaviour that violates this code of conduct, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event space. We do not currently charge for event attendance but should one have been charged there would be no refund.

Thank you for helping make this a welcoming, friendly event for all.

### Weapons Policy

No weapons are allowed at our events, including but not limited to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and will only be allowed to return without the weapon.

Attendees are further expected to comply with all ~~state and local~~ laws on this matter.

For the purpose of clarification model weapons which are part of a game are allowed for the playing of that game. 

## Scope

All attendees are subject to the Code of Conduct. This includes ABC Games organisers and volunteers, ~~as well as attendees of the tutorials, workshops, summits, poster sessions, receptions, conference, sprints, and sponsored or unofficial events~~.

~~Exhibitors in the expo hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject to the Code of Conduct. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.~~

Text struck out was relevant for the original text as a professional conference but is not necessary for us.

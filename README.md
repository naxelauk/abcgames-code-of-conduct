ABC Games Code of Conduct
=======================

This repository holds the canonical version of the ABC Games Code of Conduct.

It was originally written for the software developers (namely PyCon US) and modified to suit our style of events..

No changes are final until approved by the active Organiser Staff.

The intention is to provide clarity as to what is acceptable behaviour at our events and clarify the procedures which should be followed should that standard of behaviour be breached, or possibly breached. 

The behaviour online will probably have a different set of rules, but we may try to follow these rules there as well.

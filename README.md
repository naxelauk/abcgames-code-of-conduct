ABC Games Code of Conduct
=======================

This repository holds the canonical version of the ABC Games Code of Conduct.

 - A code of conduct for attendees and staff to read and follow
 - A set of procedures for organising staff to read and follow
 - A short procedure for attendees to follow if there are any problems.

It was originally written for the software developers (namely PyCon US) and modified to suit our style of events..


The intention is to provide clarity as to what is acceptable behaviour at our events and clarify the procedures which should be followed should that standard of behaviour be breached, or possibly breached. In writing this we hope to never need it, but we follow the philosophy that it is better to be prepared.

No changes are final until approved by the active Organiser Staff. It should be noted that several people have been "organisers" of the online forum, but that does not imply that they are currently active in organising the real life events.

As well as real life events we also run an online forum. Online activity will probably have a different set of rules, but we will try to follow these rules there unless that is impossible. 

It should be noted that games players are often known for examining rules in detail and finding loopholes. This should be discouraged and breaching the spirit of the code of conduct will be interpreted as breaching the rules themselves.

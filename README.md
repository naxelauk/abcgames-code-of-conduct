ABC Games Code of Conduct
=======================

This repository holds the canonical version of the ABC Games Code of Conduct.

It was originally written for the PyCon US Code of Conduct and modified to suit our style of events..

No changes are final until approved by the active Organiser Staff.

The intention is to provide clarity as to what is acceptable behaviour at our events and clarify the procedures 
 and versions in place for a given year will be clearly marked, the website contents on us.pycon.org will clearly state the revision of the documents posted.
